# REXPi5 – Quadruperd Spider Robot

## Description

REXPi5 is a Python-based project that transforms a Raspberry Pi 5 into a Wi-Fi controllable quadruped spider robot, driven by a PCA9685 servo driver. It features live video streaming, AI-powered human tracking, and multiple gait algorithms for versatile movement.

## Features

- **Web Interface:** Control movements (forward, back, left, right, diagonal), preset dances, and manual servo tuning via a browser.
- **Live Video Streaming:** Real-time video feed served through Flask, with optional AI-based human detection and tracking.
- **Modular Gaits:** Spider gait, REX gait, and additional walk algorithms that can be extended.
- **Hardware Abstraction:** Supports real PCA9685 hardware or a mock mode for development on non-Pi platforms.
- **Configuration:** Centralized `config.py` for tuning servo trims, camera settings, and network parameters.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nonurt/rexpi5.git
   cd rexpi5
   ```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Configure** `config.py` with your network SSID, servo trims, and camera settings.
2. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open `http://<Pi_IP>:5000` in your browser to access the control interface and video stream.
